# Requirements: FFU Builder v1.8.2

**Defined:** 2026-01-20
**Core Value:** Enable rapid, reliable Windows deployment through pre-configured FFU images with minimal manual intervention

## v1 Requirements

Requirements for v1.8.2 release. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### VMware UI Settings

- [x] **VMUI-01**: User can select VMware network type (bridged/nat/hostonly) from dropdown in UI
- [x] **VMUI-02**: User can select VMware NIC type (e1000e/vmxnet3/e1000) from dropdown in UI
- [x] **VMUI-03**: VMware network settings are persisted in configuration file
- [x] **VMUI-04**: VMware dropdowns are enabled only when VMware hypervisor is selected
- [x] **VMUI-05**: Config migration adds default VMwareSettings to existing configs (schema v1.1 → v1.2)
- [x] **VMUI-06**: UI defaults initialize VMware settings correctly on fresh launch (Get-GeneralDefaults)

## v2 Requirements

None — this is a focused patch release.

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| VMware WorkstationPath UI field | User scoped to NetworkType + NicType only |
| VMware settings validation (test connection) | Complexity not justified for v1.8.2 |
| Additional VMware settings | Keep scope minimal for patch release |

## Traceability

| Requirement | Phase | Status |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| VMUI-01 | Phase 14 | Complete |
